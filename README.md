## Note
I was exercising defensive coding and encapsulation.Also, I found out how to use assembly resources and got familiar with ReadOnlyCollection and ImmutableList which I will continue to use.
## How to play
Playing this Hangman game is easy: Simply download the repository to your computer and run hangman.sln! The game comes with its own included word list, wordlist.txt, which contains a list of 7,000+ English words from which the game can draw.

## Customization
Want to specify your own list of words in place of the included wordlist.txt? Simply overwrite that file with a text file of your own of the same filename, with each word on a separate line.

You can also add new words onto the included wordlist.txt file to be used in the game. Words can be added at any place in the file but, again, add one word per line.

## Requirements
VisualStudio installed on your computer
